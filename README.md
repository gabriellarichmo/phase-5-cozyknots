# Cozy Knots Co. README

Welcome to Cozy Knots Co.! This platform is designed for knitting and crochet enthusiasts to showcase, share, and purchase patterns. Below are instructions for setting up the server-side of the application. For a comprehensive overview of the app's functionalities and user stories,

## Installation

- Fork and clone this repository from GitHub to your local environment.
- Navigate into your local directory and open the contents in your preferred code editor.
- Run `pipenv install` to install dependencies.
- Run `pipenv shell` to create a virtual environment.
- From the main project directory, navigate to the server directory by running `cd server`.

## Introduction

Fork and clone this lesson for a template for your full-stack application. Take
a look at the directory structure before we begin (NOTE: node_modules will be
generated in a subsequent step):

```console
$ tree -L 2
$ # the -L argument limits the depth at which we look into the directory structure
.
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── LICENSE.md
├── Pipfile
├── README.md
├── client
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── public
│   └── src
└── server
    ├── app.py
    ├── config.py
    ├── models.py
    └── seed.py
```

A `migrations` folder will be added to the `server` directory in a later step.

The `client` folder contains a basic React application, while the `server`
folder contains a basic Flask application. You will adapt both folders to
implement the code for your project .

NOTE: If you did not previously install `tree` in your environment setup, MacOS
users can install this with the command `brew install tree`. WSL and Linux users
can run `sudo apt-get install tree` to download it as well.

## Where Do I Start?

Just as with your Phase 3 Project, this will likely be one of the biggest
projects you've undertaken so far. Your first task should be creating a Git
repository to keep track of your work and roll back any undesired changes.

### Removing Existing Git Configuration

If you're using this template, start off by removing the existing metadata for
Github and Canvas. Run the following command to carry this out:

```console
$ rm -rf .git .canvas
```

The `rm` command removes files from your computer's memory. The `-r` flag tells
the console to remove _recursively_, which allows the command to remove
directories and the files within them. `-f` removes them permanently.

`.git` contains this directory's configuration to track changes and push to
Github (you want to track and push _your own_ changes instead), and `.canvas`
contains the metadata to create a Canvas page from your Git repo. You don't have
the permissions to edit our Canvas course, so it's not worth keeping around.

## Setup

### `server/`

The `server/` directory contains all of your backend code.

`app.py` is your Flask application. You'll want to use Flask to build a simple
API backend like we have in previous modules. You should use Flask-RESTful for
your routes. You should be familiar with `models.py` and `seed.py` by now, but
remember that you will need to use Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, and
SQLAlchemy-Serializer instead of SQLAlchemy and Alembic in your models.

The project contains a default `Pipfile` with some basic dependencies. You may
adapt the `Pipfile` if there are additional dependencies you want to add for
your project.

To download the dependencies for the backend server, run:

```console
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

You can run your Flask API on [`localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555) by
running:

```console
python server/app.py
```

Check that your server serves the default route `http://localhost:5555`. You
should see a web page with the heading "Project Server".

### `client/`

The `client/` directory contains all of your frontend code. The file
`package.json` has been configured with common React application dependencies,
include `react-router-dom`. The file also sets the `proxy` field to forward
requests to `"http://localhost:5555". Feel free to change this to another port-
just remember to configure your Flask app to use another port as well!

To download the dependencies for the frontend client, run:

```console
npm install --prefix client
```

You can run your React app on [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) by
running:

```sh
npm start --prefix client
```

Check that your the React client displays a default page
`http://localhost:3000`. You should see a web page with the heading "Project
Client".

## Generating Your Database

NOTE: The initial project directory structure does not contain the `instance` or
`migrations` folders. Change into the `server` directory:

```console
cd server
```

Then enter the commands to create the `instance` and `migrations` folders and
the database `app.db` file:

```
flask db init
flask db upgrade head
```

Type `tree -L 2` within the `server` folder to confirm the new directory
structure:

```console
.
├── app.py
├── config.py
├── instance
│   └── app.db
├── migrations
│   ├── README
│   ├── __pycache__
│   ├── alembic.ini
│   ├── env.py
│   ├── script.py.mako
│   └── versions
├── models.py
└── seed.py
```

Edit `models.py` and start creating your models. Import your models as needed in
other modules, i.e. `from models import ...`.

Remember to regularly run
`flask db revision --autogenerate -m'<descriptive message>'`, replacing
`<descriptive message>` with an appropriate message, and `flask db upgrade head`
to track your modifications to the database and create checkpoints in case you
ever need to roll those modifications back.

> **Tip: It's always a good idea to start with an empty revision! This allows
> you to roll all the way back while still holding onto your database. You can
> create this empty revision with `flask db revision -m'Create DB'`.**

If you want to seed your database, now would be a great time to write out your
`seed.py` script and run it to generate some test data. Faker has been included
in the Pipfile if you'd like to use that library.
